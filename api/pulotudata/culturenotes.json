Their autonym is 'Sama' and if they need to distinguish themselves from the shore-dwelling Sama people, they call themselves 'Sama Dilaut' ('Sama of the Sea').

'Bajau' is apparently an Indonesian name name for boat-dwelling people that was transferred to the Sama people in Borneo, both land-dwelling and boat-dwelling. In the Sulu Archipelago, 'Bajau' is commonly used by outsiders for the Sama Dilaut, but not for other Sama people.  The earliest visitors to Sulu referred to the Sama Dilaut as 'Bajau' and that name became established in the ethnographic literature for the full-time and part-time boat-dwelling Samal of Sulu. I followed that tradition and referred to the Sama Dilaut as 'Bajau' in previous publications. I was always uncomfortable about doing so and in recent years have become increasingly so ...
