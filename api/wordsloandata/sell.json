The antiquity of this form is unclear.  It’s distribution is entirely within an area that has been subject to Malay-dominated commerce for many centuries, and so the possibility is very real that many of these forms could ultimately be Malay loanwords.  The word was present in Old Javanese in a form that differs from Malay jual, suggesting that it has been circulating in western Indonesian for over a millennium, but this is still consistent with a Malay source, since Sriwijaya dominated commerce in the Malay archipelago by at least the 7th century AD.\\r\\nThe semantics of Sumatran forms such as Gayō juel-en also suggest that if this word is a Malay loan it was borrowed early enough to become thoroughly enmeshed in the cultural traditions of the borrowing society.\",\"origin\":\"Javanese\",\"originForeign\":false,\"langISOCode\":\"sas\",\"langISOLink\":\"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sas\",\"langLocation\":\"Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara)\",\"lat\":-8.6679,\"long\":116.2793}]"]
