This Sanskrit loanword entered Malay and Old Javanese during the Indianization of western Indonesia.  It was later spread to the Philippines through Malay traders, who probably concentrated their efforts mostly in the Tagalog-speaking region of Manila Bay.  From Tagalog it reached areas of the northern Philippines that apparently never came under direct Malay contact influence.  Given his usual practice of including pseudo-reconstructions for loanwords with a distribution that would justify an attribution to his ‘Proto-Indonesian’ if they were native, it is noteworthy that Dempwolff (1938) did not include this form.  The reason for this exclusion may have been phonotactic, since a reconstruction *saksi would violate his otherwise exceptionless template of CVCVC forms or CVCCVC forms which were either reduplicated monosyllables or unreduplicated bases with homorganic medial prenasalization.  Finally, the extent to which this form has been integrated into native morphological paradigms is a warning that loanwords cannot easily be detected by their exclusion from indigenous word-building mechanisms.\",\"origin\":\"Sanskrit\",\"originForeign\":true,\"langISOCode\":\"sas\",\"langISOLink\":\"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sas\",\"langLocation\":\"Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara)\",\"lat\":-8.6679,\"long\":116.2793}]"]
